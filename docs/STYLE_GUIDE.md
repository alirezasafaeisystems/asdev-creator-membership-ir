# Style Guide

## Documentation Style
- Keep docs short, operational, and testable.
- Use one source of truth per topic; cross-link instead of duplicating.
- Prefer explicit commands over narrative.
- Keep section order stable: Purpose -> Commands -> Verification -> Troubleshooting.

## Language and Formatting
- Use English for technical primitives and command examples.
- Use concise Persian notes where local context helps.
- Use consistent path and endpoint notation with backticks.

## Maintenance Rules
- Update docs in the same PR as behavior changes.
- Remove stale snippets and obsolete commands immediately.
- Timestamp generated/runtime docs and separate them from static specs.
