# Payments Payouts Audit

Payment and payout flows are audited end-to-end.

- payment events are recorded with immutable audit identifiers.
- payout execution is reconciled with accounting exports.
- audit trails are retained for compliance.
- idempotent handlers prevent duplicate payment or payout effects.
